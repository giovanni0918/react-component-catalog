# React Component Catalog
My React component library. Designed to organize, test, and maintain the stateless functional components I use across all my React apps.

## Demo
View the Catalog: [https://giovanni-orlando.com/react-component-catalog/](https://giovanni-orlando.com/react-component-catalog/)

## Flow-Typed
Every component written in this Catalog is statically type checked using [Flow](https://flow.org/).

## Tested Thoroughly
Each of the components in this library includes its own set of tests written using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) to ensure the correct behavior.
